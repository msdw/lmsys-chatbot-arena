# 15th LMSYS - Chatbot Arena Human Preference Predictions



## Data

The competition dataset consists of user interactions from the ChatBot Arena. In each user interaction a judge provides one or more prompts to two different large language models, and then indicates which of the models gave the more satisfactory response. The goal of the competition is to predict the preferences of the judges and determine the likelihood that a given prompt/response pair is selected as the winner.
